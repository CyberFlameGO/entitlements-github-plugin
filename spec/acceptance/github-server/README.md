# github-server

Hey there! This is a stub to service selected github.com API calls that entitlements-app uses.

Also, if you are concerned about `ssl.key` being a credential in a repo, please note that it was generated specifically for this acceptance test and it is used nowhere else -- `github.fake` does not actually exist (at the time of this writing, anyway).
